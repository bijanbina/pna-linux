# Linux kernel - variant from Dampaee Group

The Linux kernel in this repository is the [Linux kernel from Xilinx](https://github.com/Xilinx/linux-xlnx) together with drivers & patches applied from Analog Devices and DTSI files for PNA6 board.

Details about the drivers that are of interest [and supported] by this repository can be found on the [Analog Devices wiki](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-drivers-all). This readme focuses on details specific to how this code is structured/organized, how it was derived, etc.

The current version of upstream Linux that Xilinx merged into their tree is from [Linux 4.14](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux.git/tag/?h=v4.14). No other patches seem to have been added after this (by Xilinx).
